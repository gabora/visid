The VisId toolbox relies on 3 free MATLAB Toolboxes:
1/AMIGO2 (https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox/download) is used to
  to store, simulate and calibrate the models. Further it implements symbolic
  computation of the Jacobian matrices.
2/MEIGO (https://sites.google.com/site/amigo2toolbox/download). This toolbox
  contains an implementation for the Variable Neighbouring Search (VNS) integer
  optimization method. 
3/RRQR (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18591-rank-revealing-qr-factorization)
 rank revealing QR decomposition is used to initialize the global optimizer.

These toolboxes must be installed in order to have a working version of VisID.
